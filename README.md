# Analyzing Patient Readmission Drivers with SQL
The Revolving Door: An Analysis of Hospital Readmissions

---

## About the Dataset & Tools
This project uses a publicly available dataset from Kaggle (find it here), containing 10 years of hospital encounter data (1999â€“2008) from 130 U.S. hospitals. It includes over 100,000 anonymized records of patients with diabetes, capturing demographics, lab results, medications, length of stay, and outcomes.

## Key Questions: An SQL-Driven Inquiry
1. Readmission Analysis by Demographics
- Which patient age groups and genders are most frequently readmitted?
- How do readmission rates compare across different patient races?

2. Impact of Medication on Readmission
   
- How does the number of medications a patient is prescribed correlate with their readmission risk?
- Are patients taking specific medications, such as insulin, more likely to be readmitted?

3. Hospital Stay and Readmission Relationship
   
- How does the length of a patient's hospital stay relate to their likelihood of being readmitted?
- Do patients admitted through the emergency room have a higher readmission rate than those with elective admissions?
