# Analyzing Patient Readmission Drivers with SQL
The Revolving Door: An Analysis of Hospital Readmissions

---

## Key Questions: An SQL-Driven Inquiry
1. Readmission Analysis by Demographics
- Which patient age groups and genders are most frequently readmitted?
- How do readmission rates compare across different patient races?

2. Impact of Medication on Readmission
   
- How does the number of medications a patient is prescribed correlate with their readmission risk?
- Are patients taking specific medications, such as insulin, more likely to be readmitted?

3. Hospital Stay and Readmission Relationship
   
- How does the length of a patient's hospital stay relate to their likelihood of being readmitted?
- Do patients admitted through the emergency room have a higher readmission rate than those with elective admissions?
